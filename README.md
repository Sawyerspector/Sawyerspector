# 👋 Hi, I'm Sawyer Spector

I'm a Duke University computer science student with a focus on **systems programming**, **computer architecture**, and **product-driven software development**.  
I work across low-level engineering (C, assembly, CPU design), UI/UX design, and entrepreneurship-driven tech projects.

---

## Technical Focus Areas
- **Systems & Architecture:** C programming, MIPS assembly, CPU/datapath design, digital logic
- **Software Engineering:** Java, C#, Python, Git workflows
- **Embedded & Hardware-adjacent work:** Logisim Evolution, timing logic, memory structures
- **Product & UX:** App design, Figma, rapid prototyping, feature development

## Featured Projects

### 🔹 [CS250 Computer Architecture Portfolio](https://github.com/Sawyerspector/cs250-computer-architecture-projects)
A curated collection of:
- C systems programs (dynamic memory, data structures)
- MIPS assembly implementations (recursion, data parsing, linked lists)
- Digital logic circuits (Boolean logic, 16-bit adder/subtractor, FSMs)
- A full **16-bit single-cycle CPU** designed from scratch in Logisim Evolution

### 🔹 [Greysun — Greyband Portfolio](https://github.com/Sawyerspector/Greysun-Greyband-Portfolio)
Product, UX, and marketing work for a wearable breathalyzer startup.  
Includes app design, hardware–software interaction concepts, and UX flows.

### 🔹 [UCLA Game Lab Portfolio](https://github.com/Sawyerspector/UCLA-GameLab-Portfolio)
Game design + rapid prototyping portfolio created during the UCLA Game Lab Summer Institute.  
Focuses on gameplay systems, level design, and interactive narrative.
